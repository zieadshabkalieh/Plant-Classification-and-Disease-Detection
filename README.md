# 🌿 Plant Classification and Disease Detection  
**Deep Learning–Based Image Analysis for Agricultural Decision Support**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an **AI-based system for plant classification and plant leaf disease detection** using deep learning and computer vision techniques.  
The system analyzes leaf images and predicts the corresponding **plant class and/or disease category**, providing a **confidence score** for each prediction.

The objective of this project is to support **early disease detection**, improve **agricultural monitoring**, and demonstrate the practical application of **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** in real-world image classification problems.
